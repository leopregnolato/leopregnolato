Hi, I’m @leopregnolato. I was born in Guarulhos (Brazil - SP) and I raised in Itaquaquecetuba (Brazil - SP). I did my basic school in the same city. 
I started my professional career as a geography teacher in the public and private schools. I taught Informatics to elementary school students in the public schools
in São Paulo city, which made my interest in technology grow. I graduated in Natural Sciences in my second graduation at the University of São Paulo (USP), 
which put me in touch with mathematics in my first scientific initiation, in which I studied number theory. As I get involved with the exact ones, I am currently 
developing academic research at the doctoral degree at the USP Sustainability Graduate Program, studying marine bioindicators in the field
of Environmental Science and Technology. A survey employs high-level technologies available at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS - Brazil) at the 
National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM). My interest in technology became my main activity, because my research involves a large volume 
of data, programming and statistics. Then I learned to deal with R programming. In order not to have problems with the expenses of software licenses owners, 
I always use, as much as possible, open source softwares. This way was easier to me through the use of Linux (Ubuntu, Mint and Elementary OS),
a system that I loved! In addition, I developeded editorial skills. LaTex editing (documents and beamer), image processing with Inkscape and Gimp, geospatial 
data processing with Qgis and advanced use of Excel are among the technologies that I work with.
